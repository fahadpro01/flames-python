F.L.A.M.E.S
=============
Flames is my first application program coded using python 3.0
<br>F.L.A.M.E.S method is used to checkout the compatibility between two given names. The methodology of the game is two first select two names. Then common alphabets between two names are omitted. The total of available alphabets is considered. The total is then iterated on the word FLAMES. The alphabet at which the total ends is omitted and again the counting is started from next corresponding alphabet. This process is continued untill only one alphabet is left.
<br>
The abbreviation of each letter in this code is as follows<br>
F->Friends<br>
L->lover<br>
A->Acquaintance<br>
M->Marriage<br>
E->Enemy<br>
S->Siblings<br>
